Hi, I am Murthy from Bangalore. 
This is a small introduction about me.
I am a Cloud and Devops Enthusiast learning and upgrading myself everyday.
Previosly I worked as a senior analyst at HCLTech.
My role was to develop and maintain AWS automation scripts using terraform as IaC. 
I have some experience developing terraform scripts for AWS.


Note: This is the first time that I have recored myself. So, I hope this video to be fine.

If everything goes well and my work gets selected, lets catchup in our 1st round interview with the team member. 

Thank you
